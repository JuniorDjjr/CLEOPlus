Install ".cs" and enter the commands below to run certain tests.
The .cs file may or may not be compatible with Sanny Builder decompilation, as it was compiled with gta3script.

"P1"
"EXIT" to exit
Shows the text for each drawing event (DRAW_EVENT).
This can be useful if all drawing events are being called in your game.
It is common for hud mods such as GTA V Hud and Classic Hud to not support certain events, for example, the drawing on the radar / minimap.
If you create mods, notice that the most "reliable" are "BEFORE_HUD", "AFTER_HUD" and "AFTER_FADE". Avoid using events related to radar and blips.

"P2"
Action command to exit (Triangle or F/Enter)
Creates a graffiti object and places it on the surface in front of the camera.

"P3"
Draws two sprites using a mask. You can move them with numpad numbers and - +
Realize that it may not work in RenderHook; limitation of it.

"P4"
Creates a new script based on a label and then changes the value of a variable in that new script.
"EXIT" to close the new script.

"P5"
Simply close the test script. Note that the "child" script created with P4 is also closed.

"P6"
Starts a kind of editor to place objects in the CJ. It was programmed quickly just for testing, so the usage is pretty bad.
To use, hold - + (from the numpad) and then press the B M P R S D H L XYZ keys where each key indicates some action.
For example holding + and pressing B increases the Bone ID, M for the Model id etc. P with X Y or Z to change the position.
You can make various combinations, like holding + together with R and X to increase the X rotation (if your keyboard does not have antighost, the problem is yours).
There is also a way to hold SHIFT to go up or down faster.

"P7"
"EXIT" to exit
Press Y to simulate a shot using the current weapon. It is a useful example for cover mods etc. Realize that the shot always comes out in front of the person, not the gun, because this is how the game works.

"P8"
"EXIT" to exit
Render an "image" with gradient noise. You can use + and - from numpad with the letters that appear on the interface to adjust the parameters.
Note that this is a very slow process not because of the gradient noise, but because, as it is only a test, 100x100 DRAW_TEXTURE_PLUS commands were used, one for each "pixel" to form the image.
Also disable SCRLog to avoid lag. Just use this to test the perlin noise values.
