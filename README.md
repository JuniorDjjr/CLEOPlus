Mobile port:  
Killman was porting CLEO+ to mobile, but he's definitely not an easy person to deal with, [he and his community constantly attacking me even though I haven't done anything against him in years](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2022/03/report-cheeseburger-mod-stealer/) (I'm not even active in the modding community anymore since 2023), a community that even constantly defends the stealing of mods *"because modding is just for fun, it's just a game, nobody cares"*. Because of this, I've decided not to permit the mobile port from Killman. If you want to port it and is not associated with him, please contact me so I can give you permission and support.
