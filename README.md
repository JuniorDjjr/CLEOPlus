Mobile port:  
Killman was porting CLEO+ to mobile, but he's definitely not an easy person to deal with, [he and his community constantly attacking me even though I haven't done anything against him in years](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2022/03/report-cheeseburger-mod-stealer/) (I'm not even active in the modding community anymore since 2023), a community that even constantly defends the stealing of mods *"because modding is just for fun, it's just a game, nobody cares"*. Because of this, I've decided not to permit the mobile port from Killman. If you want to port it and is not associated with him, please contact me so I can give you permission and support.  
**Update:** After I stopped allowing him to continue porting, he started swearing at me (even though I have never treated him badly, and I challenge anyone to find messages of me saying bad things about him) and said that he will port it anyway and that I won't be able to stop him. Unfortunately, I will have to take actions to take it down. If you see it posted anywhere, help me by reporting it to the site where it was posted, linking to this. I'm not specifically accusing him, but this seems to be related to this culture of the [mobile community stealing PC mods](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2022/03/report-cheeseburger-mod-stealer/), his community really wants this port because PC mods use it today. He also lied saying that I broke the [SimplexNoise](https://github.com/SRombauts/SimplexNoise/) license, even though it is MIT (extremely open to copying, redistribution, sublicensing, etc.), and it is preserved [here](https://github.com/JuniorDjjr/CLEOPlus/blob/main/CLEOPlus/PerlinNoise/SimplexNoise.cpp#L23).  
*"Ah, but CLEO+ is also MIT licensed and therefore he can modify it."* [Android ModLoader](https://github.com/AndroidModLoader/AndroidModLoader?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) is also MIT and when I posted it on [MixMods](https://www.mixmods.com.br), for some reason he told me to remove it (even though the license allows copying and publishing, I was within the license), and I didn't even try to convince him (I even talked to him explaining that I didn't know he didn't allow it because someone else told me, and I'm not active on the modding community anymore, much less the mobile modding community, and saying that I'll remove it without any problems), I simply removed it, because I've always respected the decisions of modders ([except once, with good reason](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2020/10/segundo-gta-forums-eu-sou-plagiador/)). He should also respect my decision, just as I respected his, and stop looking for fights on the internet.  
I don't want to change the CLEO+ license, because that would impact other people who have nothing to do with it (I'm a big supporter of the open source movement).
